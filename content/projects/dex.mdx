A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates on a blockchain network and allows users to trade digital assets directly with each other without the need for an intermediary. The term "DEX" is often used to refer to platforms or protocols that facilitate peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading in a decentralized manner.

In a traditional centralized exchange, a central authority holds custody of users' funds and facilitates the trading process. In contrast, a DEX eliminates the need for a centralized authority by utilizing smart contracts or other blockchain technologies to enable direct peer-to-peer trading. This means that users retain control of their funds throughout the trading process, reducing the risk of hacking or loss due to exchange vulnerabilities.

DEX platforms typically provide users with a decentralized order book, where buy and sell orders are matched automatically. Trading on a DEX often requires the use of a wallet that supports the specific blockchain network on which the exchange operates. Users connect their wallets to the DEX platform, allowing them to manage their funds and execute trades directly from their wallets.

DEX platforms offer benefits such as increased privacy, reduced reliance on intermediaries, and potentially lower trading fees. However, it's important to note that DEXs may have lower liquidity compared to centralized exchanges and can be more complex for novice users.

Examples of popular DEX platforms include Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, and decentralized exchanges built on the Ethereum blockchain or other blockchain networks.
